# CSAW 23 Large Language Model CTF Competitions

We rescaled the scores from suggested points in this competition, there are two challenges that are easy and without masked out flags and with proper hints hence you can get familiar yourself with the competition from these two challenges.

## What to submit

For each puzzle, you should submit a report include the flag you found, the final solution steps and the log output from the LLM system you used.

We will have an in-personal presentation to present how people solved these challenges with language models on Nov. 10.

## Due date
All the challenges are due before the presentation, technically on Nov. 9.

## Check if the flag you found is correct

Once you found a flag that you thought that might be correct, please reflect it with us on the discord channel: https://discord.gg/wnAwT6qHax, hence you can see if your flag is correct or not, that should be the same on both NY and AD sites.

We have a smaller compeition for this first year hence we use this method to check the correctness instead of deploying the challenges online for better communication and management.

## Discussion

All people who participates in this competition are allowed to discuss the finding with each other even with people outside of a group, but notice that this is a competition hence you are competiting against each other.
